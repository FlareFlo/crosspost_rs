## Why have I been warned/blacklisted?

Discord imposes a rate-limit of 10 cross-posts per hour per server. 
Any messages more than that will end up in an event queue on my server, clogging up resources.
I have set up an automated system that will filter and warn servers exceeding this limit by a factor of 2.

## I have been warned, what now?

If you were warned, try to consider reducing the amount of messages put through the channel, and maybe group them into single big messages.

## I have been blacklisted, what now?

You can appeal <a href="mailto:discord@flareflo.dev?subject=Blacklist%20appeal%20&body=server-id">here</a> (must include server-id).
Unless you were deliberately attempting to spam/sabotage, getting removed from the blacklist should be no problem.
